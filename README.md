For a sample size of 𝑛 = 512 n=512, with the response variable defined as 𝑦 = 2 + 3𝑥1 + 4𝑥2 +𝑁(0,1), (where 𝑁(0,1) represents normally distributed noise with mean 0 and variance 1), 
performing a bootstrap estimation of the coefficients, using 100 iterations, provides a good approximation of the true coefficients 𝑏0=2, ​𝑏1=3 and 𝑏2=4. 
However, when comparing the confidence intervals, derived from the bootstrap method with those obtained from the OLS estimates, 
it becomes evident that, the OLS 95% confidence intervals are significantly wider. 
This suggests that the bootstrap method provides a better approximation of the true coefficients, while the OLS estimates tend to be more variable, leading to overly conservative confidence intervals.
